# WebGL Gluid Simulation

This is a fluid simulation implemented by using SPH.
See the [live demo here](https://jorovipe97.github.io/pixi-game/dist/)

## TODO:
1. Implement [Barnesâ€“Hut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation) algorithm to reduce complexity of the n-body simulation.
